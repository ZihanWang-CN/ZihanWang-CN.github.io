# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Zihan Wang (Zephyr, 王子涵)**.<br>

I am currently a master's student at the [Aerospace Information Research Institute](http://www.aircas.cn/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Bingchen Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~bczhang). My research interests focus on computer vision and brain-inspired intelligence. I expect to complete my master's degree in June 2026 and plan to pursue a Ph.D. abroad.

Prior to UCAS, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Automation from the [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/) in June 2023 and was subsequently granted direct admission—exempt from the entrance examination—to pursue my graduate studies at UCAS.
